    <History>Figured to have it represent an armory; these were common, and not all Celts (truthfully, not even most) had to provide their own weapons. Just, they had to provide their own GOOD weapons and armor, but mass-produced spears and javelins and shields were distributed freely at need. The possession of a armory by the local lord was considered quite prestigious among the Celts, especially the larger examples found in Gaul that could maintain armies.</History>
