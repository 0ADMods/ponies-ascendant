    <History>A druid may be one of many different professions; priest, historian, lawyer, judges, teachers, philosophers, poets, composers, musicians, astronomers, prophets, councilors, high craftsmen like a blacksmith, the classes of the 'men of art', and sometimes kings, chieftains, or other politicians. Druids were very hierarchical, with classes and ranks based on the length of their education and what fields they practiced. They learned their trades through mnemonics by way of poetry and songs, as writing was rarely used by Celts outside of prayers on votive objects, or lists of names for migratory records.</History>
